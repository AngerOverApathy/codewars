// Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
// For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
// Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)
// Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
// function squareDigits(num){
//     return Number(String(num).split('').map(digit => digit ** 2).join(''))
//   }

// Trolls are attacking your comment section!
// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
// function disemvowel(str) {
//     return str.split('').filter(char => !'AEIOUaeiou'.includes(char)).join('')
//   }

// Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
// We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
// function getCount(str) {
//     return str.split('').filter(vowel => 'aeiou'.includes(vowel)).length;
//   }

// Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.
// Task
// Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.
// Examples (Input --> Output)
// [1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
// [2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
// [1]         --> [1,1]
// Remarks
// All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.
// function minMax(arr){
//     return [Math.min(...arr), Math.max(...arr)];
//   }

// The museum of incredible dull things
// The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.
// However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.
// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.
// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.
// function removeSmallest(numbers) {
//     let arrCopy = numbers.slice()
//     let smallestNum = Math.min(...arrCopy)
//     let smallestNumIdx = arrCopy.indexOf(smallestNum)
//     arrCopy.splice(smallestNumIdx, 1)
//     return arrCopy
//   }

// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false
// var isSquare = function(n){
//     return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))
// }

// In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
// function filter_list(l) {
//     return l.filter(num => typeof num === 'number')
//   }

// In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
// function highAndLow(numbers){
//     let numArr = numbers.split(' ').map(Number)
//     let highNum = Math.max(...numArr)
//     let lowNum = Math.min(...numArr)
    
//     return `${highNum} ${lowNum}`   
//   }

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.
Examples input/output:
XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false
